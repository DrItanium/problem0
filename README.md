This repo contains my solutions to the Fall 2011 [Cal Poly Pomona programming contest](http://www.csupomona.edu/~carich/programming_contests/) "Problem 0", called [Change Machine](http://www.csupomona.edu/~carich/programming_contests/201104/change_machine.pdf).

This was a simple warm-up problem given the week before the actual contest.  To make things interesting for the veterans, participants were challenged to write the smallest possible solution (measured in source bytes).  [Correct submissions](http://www.csupomona.edu/~carich/programming_contests/201104/problem0/?C=S;O=A) were then gathered and displayed for everyone to admire.  I had the smallest solution, at 96 bytes of Perl code.

I actually had the foresight while writing my solutions to maintain a version control log of my progress.  Now I (and those who gawked at my final results) get to look at the evolution of a piece of golfed code.
